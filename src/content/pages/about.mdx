summary: "A short introduction to who I am"

Where to start? I'm a software engineer in my mid 20s. I graduated just a
few years ago and I'm currently employed at a web agency.

I'm not sure what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going
through the motions. The past few years have passed by so fast which —in
some ways—is a nice change of pace compared to my high school years. But
it's also a bit scary: when days turns into weeks and weeks turns into
months, I feel like I'm not living life to the fullest. Like I'm not being
the person I want to be.

I quickly run out of things to say. I often wonder if I'm not just a boring
fellow. I hope this blog helps convincing myself otherwise.
