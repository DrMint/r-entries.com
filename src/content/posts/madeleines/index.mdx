This is a recipe for about 42 Madeleines.

## Ingredients

- 375g flour
- 250g sugar
- 50g honey (preferably the intense kind like chestnut honey)
- 250g butter
- 9 whole eggs
- 1 sachet of baking powder
- Some Grand Marnier and/or vanilla extract and/or lemon zest
- 2 pinches of salt

If you don't want to make such a large quantity, here's the ingredients for about 16 madeleines:

- 150g flour
- 100g sugar
- 20g honey
- 100g butter
- 4 whole eggs
- 1/2 sachet of baking powder
- Some Grand Marnier and/or vanilla extract and/or lemon zest
- 1 pinch of salt

## Steps

1. In a big bowl, beat the eggs (9), then mix in the sugar (250g) and honey (50g).
2. Mix in some Grand Marnier and/or vanilla extract and/or lemon zest.
3. Mix in the molten butter (250g), the salt (2 pinches), the baking powder (1 sachet), and the flour (375g).
4. Mix until homogenized.
5. For the madeleines to have their signature shape, they need to be subjected to a thermal shock. That's why we need to leave the mixture in the fridge for a couple hours.
6. Preheat your oven to 240°C.
7. Butter the molds (oil is fine too), place them on a tray and pour the mixture in the molds.
8. Bake at 220°C for 4 minutes then turn down the temperature again to 180°C and bake for another 6-8 minutes.
9. Considering the quantity of the mixture, you'll likely need to bake multiple batches. Repeat steps 5 to 7.
10. Let them cool down and then enjoy!
11. You can store them in a airtight container for a couple days. They also freeze well.
