## First checks

Congratulations, you've just received your Steam Deck! Here's a few things you can check to make sure everything is working as expected:

- Check and apply updates
- Settings
	- Controller
		- Test Device Input
		- Calibration & Advanced Settings
			- Reduce deadzones until the joysticks starts registering movements when immobile. Then increase the deadzone by one step.
	- Downloads
		- Allow download during gameplay
- Test for dead pixels
	1. Go to Desktop mode
	2. Go to https://lcdtech.info/en/tests/dead.pixel.htm


## Troubleshooting

### Audio issues

> Everytime the Steam Deck is rebooted, the audio stops working because it defaults to a nonexistent "External speakers" instead of the regular "Speakers".

1. Go to **Desktop Mode** by holding the power button and selecting the option
2. Open the **System Settings**
3. In the **Hardware** section, open the **Audio** page
4. In the **Playback Devices** find "Rembrandt Radeon High Definition Audio Controller"
5. By default, its "Profile" should be set to **Pro Audio**. Change it **Off**
6. Restart the device

### Wi-Fi issues

> The Steam Deck keeps losing connectivity. I'm getting the following error: **Steam servers can't be reached**.

This is likely to be an compatibility issue between the Steam Deck and particular Wi-Fi access points/brands or particular wifi network configurations. Follow these steps to fix it: 

1. Start the device in gaming mode and open the **Settings**
2. In the **System** tab, turn on **Developer Mode**
3. Navigate to the **Developer** tab and disable "Enable WiFi Power Management"
4. Restart the device after making these changes



### Annoying KDE Wallet popups in desktop mode

Edit `/home/deck/.config/kwalletrc`  
Add `Enabled=false` at the end of the file



## Desktop Mode

### Set sudo password

Go to settings / users / select user and change password

### Add nested desktop to gaming mode

Right click on `/usr/share/applications/steam/steamos-nested-desktop/steamos-nested-desktop.desktop` and press add to steam

### Transfer Firefox profile

Transfer profile folder and `profiles.ini` file to `/home/deck/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/`

If you want to see the list of profiles, run `flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox -P`




### Remap keyboard

Using X11 XKB, start by dumping the current keyboard layout using this command
```sh
xkbcomp $DISPLAY my_keyboard.xkb
```

After modification, reapply using:
```sh
xkbcomp my_keyboard.xkb $DISPLAY
```

#### Additional tools and tricks

Display currently pressed key codes using:
```sh
sudo showkey
```


### Access serial ports

I'm testing serial port through
```sh
flatpak install org.thonny.Thonny
```

Add yourself to the uucp group

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G uucp deck
```





### Webdev

#### Podman & distrobox

Since SteamOS version 3.5, the deck comes with podman and distrobox preinstalled. This makes installing apps, tools, and library in a sudoless/immutable OS feasible. This also enables you to use various package managers such as apt (Debian/Ubuntu), pacman (Arch), yum (Fedora).
