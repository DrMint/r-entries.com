Welcome to the beautiful world of Markdown and MDX.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with a plain text formatting syntax.
It is regularly used to format message online, including on Discord.

Right now, you could either be on the website reading this post, or
reading directly from its corresponding markdown file.

Let's starts with some basics!

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

Two lines of text without a blank line in between are part
of the same paragraph. Single line breaks are only used to
make the markdown more readable and will not be displayed.

You can force a line break with two spaces at the end of the line.  
I just did, and so this line will be displayed as a new line.

You can achieve the same thing with a backslash at the end.\
This line should also be displayed as a new line.

Multiple line breaks in the markdown file are not displayed.
There was a bunch of them right now and you saw nothing... spooky.
(unless you're reading the markdown file directly)

If you ACTUALLY want to add blank lines, you can use \<br /> tags.

<br />
<br />
I'm a lonely line...
<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's move on to the cool stuff!

You can have headings, aka titles.

## This is a title for a section of this post

### This is the title for a subsection

#### You can go really deep

##### You probably should never go this deep

###### You're reached rock bottom

Anyway, headings are used to structure the post.
Let's use one right now to start a new section.

## Inline elements

**Bold** is quite nice, isn't it? Actually you can do bold with **two underscores** or **two asterisks**.
There is also _italic_: same thing, you can use _an underscore_ or _an asterisk_.

There is also ~~strikethrough~~, which can be done with ~~two tildes~~ or ~a single tilde~.

Finally, you can mix them together: here, a _**bold italic**_ word.

<u>Underline</u> is achieve with HTML tags, same with
<mark>highlighted text</mark>.

Backticks are used to display inline `code`.

You can anotate a word such as <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> (hover the word to see the tooltip).

You can also use subscripts (i.e. H<sub>2</sub>O) and superscripts (i.e. X<sup>n</sup> + Y<sup>n</sup> = Z<sup>n</sup>).

If you express keyboard inputs with the \<kbd> tag: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> to select all.

Double dashes--like these--are automatically converted to en-dashes.

Here's a simple sentence with a footnote [^1].
[^1]: This is the content of the footnote.

## Lists

You can use unordered lists with `*`, `+` or `-` to create a list item.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

You can also use ordered lists with numbers.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

You can also nest lists.

- Item 1
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
- Item 2
- Item 3

And even combine unordered and ordered lists.

1. Item 1
   - Subitem 1
   - Subitem 2
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

Pretty wild!

Does checklist work?

- [ ] Item 1
- [x] Item 2
- [ ] Item 3

Hurray! They do work.

## Blocks

### Code blocks

You can use blocks to display code blocks.

```
A block code block
    unlike paragraphs
        preserves whitespace
```

Typically these are used for sharing bits of code. Here's an example:

```ts
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = a + b;
console.log(c); // 3
```

You can specify the programming language of the code block next to the opening backticks. The provided language will be used for syntax highlighting. Here's different languages:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

Long lines of code don't get wrapped to the next line:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Time start = new Time(8, 12, 15);
    Time stop = new Time(12, 34, 55);
    Time diff;

    // call difference method
    diff = difference(start, stop);

    System.out.printf("TIME DIFFERENCE: %d:%d:%d - %d:%d:%d = %d:%d:%d\n", start.hours, start.minutes, start.seconds, stop.hours, stop.minutes, stop.seconds, diff.hours, diff.minutes, diff.seconds);
}
```

#### Titles and captions

You can set a title :

```java title="src/main/java/com/drmint/helloworld/App.java"
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

You can also set some caption:

```java title="src/main/java/com/drmint/helloworld/App.java" caption="A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax."
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### Line numbers

You can display the line numbers

```java showLineNumbers
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

You can also set the starting line number:

```java title="src/main/java/com/drmint/helloworld/App.java" showLineNumbers{97}
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### Highlighting

You can set the range of lines to highlight:

```ts {3-5, 8} showLineNumbers
async function highlightCode(code: string) {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypePrettyCode, {
      keepBackground: false,
    })
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process(code);

  return String(file);
}
```

And you can set them as insertions or deletions:

```ts {3,4}#del {5-7}#ins showLineNumbers
async function highlightCode(code: string) {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypePrettyCode, {
      keepBackground: false,
    })
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process(code);

  return String(file);
}
```

You can set words to highlight:

```js /age/#v /name/#v /setAge/#s /setName/#s /50/#i /"Taylor"/#i
const [age, setAge] = useState(50);
const [name, setName] = useState("Taylor");
```

And just like lines, you can set them as insertions or deletions:

```css "left"#del "inline"#ins
blockquote {
  margin-leftinline: unset;
  background-color: var(--foreground-5-transparent);
}
```

#### Inline code

Let's consider the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Maybe you want to talk about a section of this code and you want proper highlighting with inline code.

You can use the `\{:java}` to specify the language of the code.
Here, `public class HelloWorld{:java}` is properly highlighted.
However, it doesn't work if there isn't enought context.

For example, `main{:java}` is not highlighted correctly because it's impossible to know what "main" refers to without context.
You can provide the context by using the `\{:.entity.name.function}` meta string.
Now, `main{:.entity.name.function}` is properly highlighted.

We can do the same with `args{:.entity.name.variable}`, `HelloWorld{:.entity.name.class}`, or `public{:.keyword}`.
To find more of these meta string, you can check `node_modules/@shikijs/themes/dist/dark-plus.mjs`.

### Blockquotes

You can use blockquotes to display quotes.

> This is a blockquote

> Here's another one. You can write a lot of things here.  
> It can be multiple lines, and you can use other markdown elements like **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~.

> ```
>
> And god knows what else. Maybe more blockquotes?
>

>
> > > This is a doubly nested blockquote

Alright enought with blockquotes.

### Callouts

#### Types

You can set the callout's type with the `[!type]` syntax. This will affect the
callout's icon and color. The colors only works on browsers that support
`color-mix` which is supported by all major browsers since May 2023.

## Images

The alternative text is required.

<MdxImage src={mdxLogo} alt="The MDX logo" />

You can also have a caption which by default is the alternative text.

<MdxImage src={mdxLogo} alt="The MDX logo" caption />

You can also have a caption with a custom text.

<MdxImage src={mdxLogo} alt="The MDX logo" caption="Hello! I'm a caption ^^" />

## Tables

You can use tables to display data.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
| Cell 7   | Cell 8   | Cell 9   |

You can align the columns to the left, right, or center.

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Cell 1       |     Cell 2     |        Cell 3 |
| Cell 4       |     Cell 5     |        Cell 6 |
| Cell 7       |     Cell 8     |        Cell 9 |

## Others

You can have horizontal rules.
