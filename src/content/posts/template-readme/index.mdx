STRICT is a blogging template for [Astro](https://astro.build/),
which I created for my blog [r-entries.com](https://r-entries.com).

Starting this project, I had the following requirements:

- **Static site generation**, so the website loads fast, has lower hosting costs, and can be hosted anywhere.
- **No client-side JavaScript required**. Some JS can be sprinkled in for <abbr title="Quality of Life">QoL</abbr> features--if impossible otherwise--using the [Progressive Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) strategy.
- **Minimal dependencies**, both for the static generation and client-side.
  - No UI framework, no CSS framework, no JS framework, no component library. **Cut the bloat, I want full control!**
- **Performant**. This is just a blog, any user should enjoy a smooth experience regardless of their device.
- **Respectful**
  - of user's **privacy** (no tracking, no analytics, no cookies)
  - of user's **bandwidth** (no custom fonts, optimized images)
  - of user's **preferences** (choice of web browser, light/dark mode, reduced motion, etc...)
- **SEO-friendly**, I mostly write posts for myself, but wouldn't mind if other people can find them when relevant.
- **Good editorial experience**, that's common sense for a blog. I often write about programming good **code highlighting** is a must.
- **Tags** and **post's subpages**, so user navigation is a breeze.
- **Print friendly**, I like to print my posts sometimes, especially cooking recipes.
