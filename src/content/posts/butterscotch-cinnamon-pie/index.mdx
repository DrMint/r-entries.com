## Ingredients

For the pie crust (shortcrust pastry):

- 220g flour
- 100g butter
- 40g water
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 pinches of salt

For the filling:

- 200g of brown sugar
- 60g of water
- 80g of heavy cream (cream that's at least 30% fat)
- 30g of butter
- 480g of whole milk
- 3 large egg yolks
- 50g of cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- Vanilla extract (to taste)
- Cinnamon (to taste)

## Steps

1. In a big bowl, mix the flour (220g), salt (2 pinches), egg yolk (1), and molten butter (100g).
2. When small pebbles form, add water (40g) and mix until the dough is homogeneous and flexible.
3. Transfer the dough on a floured surface and knead it into a flattened ball.
4. Roll out the dough into a circle slightly larger than the diameter of the pie dish.
5. Butter the pie dish and transfer the dough to it. If the dough extends beyond the edges, don't trim it yet.
6. Prick the dough with a fork.
7. Lay down a crumpled sheet of parchment paper inside the pie crust.
8. Place some weight inside the pie crust, typically some dried beans.
9. Bake the crust for 20 minutes at 200Â°C or until the rim of the pie crust is starting to get brown.
10. Empty the pie crust. You can now trim the excess dough before putting it back into the oven for another 20 minutes or until it's fully baked.
11. While the pie crust is baking, let's prepare the filling.
12. Place the sugar (200g) and water (60g) in a saucepan and turn on the heat until it forms a dark caramel sauce.
13. Turn off the heat and incorporate the butter (30g), most of the whole milk (400g), and heavy cream (80g).
14. In a bowl, mix the rest of the whole milk (80g), the egg yolks (2), the cornstarch (50g), and the salt (1/2 teaspoon).
15. Tamper the cornstarch mixture by adding a couple spoons of the butterscotch mixture into it while whisking.
16. Transfer everything into the saucepan and warm it up on low heat. Continuously whisk.
17. When the mixture thickens, turn off the heat, add the vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Stir one last time.
18. Pour the filling into the crust. Let it cool down and then refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
19. When you are ready to serve, you can add some whipped cream on top.
