## Starting point

Let's say we have a banner image for our webpage's hero section.
The JPEG image is 1200x300 pixels.
Here's the simplest possible HTML code to display it:

```html
<img src="banner.jpg" />
```

There are a few things we can do to improve it:

- There is no `alt{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute.
- There is no `width{:.entity.other.attribute}` and `height{:.entity.other.attribute}` attributes.
- JPEG is good but dated format.
  We can use formats with more efficient compression like AVIF or WebP instead.
- We are only providing one image size.
  If the user is on a mobile device, we are wasting bandwidth by serving a 1200x300 image.
  If the user is using a 4K monitor, the image will be blurry because of the low resolution.

## The `alt` attribute

If the image is purely decorative, the `alt{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute should be an empty string with the `role="presentation"` attribute.

```html {3-4}#ins showLineNumbers
<img 
  src="banner.jpg"
  alt=""
  role="presentation"
/>
```

If the image is not decorative, `alt{:.entity.other.attribute}` should provide a meaningful description of the image.

```html {3}#ins showLineNumbers
<img
  src="banner.jpg"
  alt="A cat looking out the window."
/>
```

## The `width` and `height` attributes

It is important for the browser to know the size of the image as soon as possible.
Otherwise, the browser cannot anticipate the layout of the page. This can lead to heavy layout shifts.
With proper `width{:.entity.other.attribute}` and `height{:.entity.other.attribute}` attributes, the browser can pre-allocate the space for the image while it is loading.

```html {3-4}#ins showLineNumbers
<img
  src="banner.jpg"
  width="1200"
  height="300"
/>
```

## Provide multiple formats

We can use the `picture{:.entity.name.tag}` element to provide multiple alternative formats.

```html {1-3,9}#ins showLineNumbers
<picture>
  <source srcset="banner.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="banner.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img
    src="banner.jpg"
    width="1200"
    height="300"
  />
</picture>
```

Now the browser will pick the first format that it supports, starting with AVIF, then WebP, and finally JPEG.

> [!info] Backwards compatibility
> If the browser doesn't support the `picture{:.entity.name.tag}` or `source{:.entity.name.tag}` elements, it will fallback to the `img{:.entity.name.tag}` child element.
> This will then behave exactly like the starting point example.

### Fallback format

AVIF and WebP support both transparent and animated images, making them suitable for almost all use cases.
However, our fallback format need to change depending on the image type:

- If the image is animated, the fallback format should be GIF.
- If the image is transparent, the fallback format should be PNG.
- Otherwise, the fallback format should be JPEG.

Example with a transparent image:

```html showLineNumbers
<picture>
  <source srcset="banner.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="banner.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img
    src="banner.png"
    width="1200"
    height="300"
  />
</picture>
```

## Provide multiple sizes

We can use the `sizes{:.entity.other.attribute}` and `srcset{:.entity.other.attribute}` attributes to provide multiple sizes, and let the browser pick the most appropriate one.

```html {5-9}#ins showLineNumbers
<img
  src="banner.jpg"
  width="1200"
  height="300"
  sizes="100vw"
  srcset="
    banner-1800w.jpg 1800w,
    banner-1200w.jpg 1200w,
    banner-600w.jpg  600w"
/>
```

Here we are providing three sizes: `1800px{:.string}`, `1200px{:.string}` and `600px{:.string}` (wide). We could provide more sizes if needed.
We are also providing the `sizes{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute to tell the browser the expected width of the image based on the viewport width.
`100vw{:.string}` means the image will always span the full width of the viewport.

Browsers can employ different strategies to pick the most appropriate size.
One would be to pick the size that is closest to the expected width of the image in the viewport.
But depending on the situation, a mobile browser might pick a smaller size, prioritizing bandwidth over resolution.

> [!info] Backwards compatibility
> If the browser doesn't support the `sizes{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute or the `srcset{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute, it will fallback to the `src{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute.
> This will then behave exactly like the starting point example.

### More advanced case

Here the same example as before, but with a different `sizes{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute:

```html {5}#del {6}#ins showLineNumbers
<img
  src="banner.jpg"
  width="1200"
  height="300"
  sizes="100vw"
  sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"
  srcset="
    banner-1800w.jpg 1800w,
    banner-1200w.jpg 1200w,
    banner-600w.jpg  600w"
/>
```

What this means if that the image is expected to be the full width of the viewport until it reaches 1000px.
After that, if the viewport is any wider, the image will stay at 1000px-wide.

### DPR and zoom level

With that more advanced case, you may be wondering why we are still providing resolutions that are larger than 1000px.
Well, depending on the device pixel ratio (DPR) and the browser's zoom level, logical pixels may not correspond to physical pixels.

First example: The user has a 1920 × 1080 screen with a DPR of 1, and a zoom level of 100%,
the viewport is above the 1000px threshold, so `sizes{:.entity.other.attribute}` will be interpreted as `1000px{:.string}`.
The **1200px**-wide image will be used as it is the closest to the expected 1000px.

But now the user zooms in to 150%, the expected image width will be 1500px, so the **1800px**-wide image will be used.

Second example: The user has a mobile device with a 1320 × 2868 screen, a DPR of 3, and a zoom level of 100%.
In terms of logical pixels, the viewport is only 440px wide (1320px / 3).
This means that when interpreting the `sizes{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute, the `(max-width: 1000px) 100vw{:.string}` rule applies and we consider the image to be 100vw, the full width of the viewport.
But the browser will also consider the DPR to determine the desired resolution for the image.
So in the end, the **1200px**-wide image will be used.

> [!warning] Don't upscale images
> If the original image is **1200px** wide, it isn't necessary to provide any version of the image larger than its original size.

## To lazy load or not to lazy load?

Example of a lazy loaded image:

```html {5-7}#ins showLineNumbers
<img
  src="banner.jpg"
  width="1200"
  height="300"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  fetchpriority="auto"
/>
```

We are asking the browser to defer loading the image until it reaches a certain distance from the viewport.
If the user never scrolls down to the image, it will not be loaded.
This is a good strategy for images that are further down the page (what we call "below the fold").

For images above the fold, here is the recommended attributes:

```html {5-7}#ins showLineNumbers
<img
  src="banner.jpg"
  width="1200"
  height="300"
  loading="eager"
  decoding="sync"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>
```

> [!info] Backwards compatibility
> Once again, if the browser doesn't support any of these attributes, it will fallback to the starting point example, where images are loaded immediately.

## In the case of `og:image`

`og:image` is part of the OpenGraph protocol, which is used by social media platforms to display a preview image when a link is shared.
Because this protocol was introduce before the introduction of WebP or AVIF, you can only be certain that PNG and JPEG are going to be supported.
That being said, all the major social media platforms currently support WebP. AVIF is only supported on a couple platforms[^1] so I would advise against using it.

As only one image is allowed, you need to pick between using a legacy format that will be supported by all platforms, or a modern format (WebP) that may not be supported everywhere.

My recommendation would be to maximize compatibility and avoid transparency as you don't know how the image will be displayed. So JPEG would be the best choice for your `og:image`.

`twitter:image` on the other hand is a Twitter/X specific property, so it's okay to use WebP[^2].

## Now altogether

With all the tips we've covered, here is the final result:

```html showLineNumbers
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="
      banner-1800w.avif 1800w,
      banner-1200w.avif 1200w,
      banner-600w.avif   600w"
    type="image/avif"
    sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"
  />
  <source
    srcset="
      banner-1800w.webp 1800w,
      banner-1200w.webp 1200w,
      banner-600w.webp   600w"
    type="image/webp"
    sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"
  />
  <source
    srcset="
      banner-1800w.jpg 1800w,
      banner-1200w.jpg 1200w,
      banner-600w.jpg   600w"
    type="image/jpeg"
    sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"
  />
  <img
    src="banner.jpg"
    alt="A cat looking out the window."
    width="1200"
    height="300"
    loading="eager"
    decoding="sync"
    fetchpriority="high"
  />
</picture>
```

## TL;DR

- Always provide an `alt{:.entity.other.attribute}` attribute. If the image is purely decorative, it should be an empty string with the `role="presentation"` attribute. If the image is not decorative, it should provide a meaningful description of the image.
- Always provide the `width{:.entity.other.attribute}` and `height{:.entity.other.attribute}` attributes to avoid layout shifts.
- There isn't a single best image format. The best solution is to provide multiple formats and let the browser pick the first one that it supports.
- AVIF and WebP are the best formats to use as your default, then fallback to whichever legacy format is appropriate for the image (JPEG, PNG, or GIF).
- The same goes with image sizes. Provide multiple sizes and let the browser pick the most appropriate one.
- Don't forget to provide resolutions that are larger than the expected width image in the viewport for cases where the DPR is above 1 and/or the zoom level is above 100%.
- For images above the fold, use `loading="eager"`, `decoding="sync"`, and `fetchpriority="high"` properties.
- For images below the fold, use `loading="lazy"`, `decoding="async"`, and `fetchpriority="auto"` properties.
- `og:image` should be a JPEG image. `twitter:image` should use WebP.
