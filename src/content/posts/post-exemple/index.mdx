Welcome to the beautiful world of Markdown and MDX.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with a plain text formatting syntax.
It is regularly used to format message online, including on Discord.

Right now, you could either be on the website reading this post, or
reading directly from its corresponding markdown file.

Let's starts with some basics!

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

Two lines of text without a blank line in between are part
of the same paragraph. Single line breaks are only used to
make the markdown more readable and will not be displayed.

You can force a line break with two spaces at the end of the line.  
I just did, and so this line will be displayed as a new line.

You can achieve the same thing with a backslash at the end.\
This line should also be displayed as a new line.

Multiple line breaks in the markdown file are not displayed.
There was a bunch of them right now and you saw nothing... spooky.
(unless you're reading the markdown file directly)

If you ACTUALLY want to add blank lines, you can use \<br /> tags.

<br />
<br />
I'm a lonely line...
<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's move on to the cool stuff!

You can have headings, aka titles.

## This is a title for a section of this post

### This is the title for a subsection

#### You can go really deep

##### You probably should never go this deep

###### You're reached rock bottom

Anyway, headings are used to structure the post.
Let's use one right now to start a new section.

## Formatting

**Bold** is quite nice, isn't it? There is also _italic_ and ~~strikethrough~~.
You can mix them together: here, a _**bold italic**_ word.

<u>Underline</u> is a little bit different, but possible.

Backticks are used to display inline `code`.

## Lists

You can use unordered lists with `*`, `+` or `-` to create a list item.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

You can also use ordered lists with numbers.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

You can also nest lists.

- Item 1
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
- Item 2
- Item 3

And even combine unordered and ordered lists.

1. Item 1
   - Subitem 1
   - Subitem 2
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

Pretty wild!

Does checklist work?

- [ ] Item 1
- [x] Item 2
- [ ] Item 3

Hurray! They do work.

## Blocks

### Code blocks

You can use blocks to display code blocks.

```
A block code block
    unlike paragraphs
        preserves whitespace
```

Typically these are used for sharing bits of code. Here's an example:

```ts
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = a + b;
console.log(c); // 3
```

You can specify the programming language of the code block next to the opening backticks. The provided language will be used for syntax highlighting. Here's different languages:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

```bash
ls -la
```

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

Stop right there cowboy! I think you've got the point.

### Blockquotes

You can use blockquotes to display quotes.

> This is a blockquote

> Here's another one. You can write a lot of things here.  
> It can be multiple lines, and you can use other markdown elements like **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~.
>
> They can have multiple paragraphs.
>
> They can even have code blocks.
>
> ```ts
> const a = 1;
> ```
>
> And god knows what else. Maybe more blockquotes?
>
> > This is a nested blockquote
>
> > > This is a doubly nested blockquote

Alright enought with blockquotes.

You can have callouts collapsible

> [!cite]+ Opened by default
> You can see me, unless you don't want to

> [!cite]- Collapse by default
> Oh, hello there! Do you want something?

## Tables

You can use tables to display data.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
| Cell 7   | Cell 8   | Cell 9   |

You can align the columns to the left, right, or center.

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Cell 1       |     Cell 2     |        Cell 3 |
| Cell 4       |     Cell 5     |        Cell 6 |
| Cell 7       |     Cell 8     |        Cell 9 |

## Other stuff

You can have horizontal rules.
